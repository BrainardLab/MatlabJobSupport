% Create a job and Docker run script for a simple calculation, via AWS CLI.
%
% This script will produce a job struct suitable for doing a simple
% calculation.  It will try to execute the job remotely using the Amazon
% Web Services Command Line Interface (aka AWS CLI).
%
% This assumes you have an AWS account set up, and have configured the AWS
% CLI for your local machine.  It also assumes you have a Linux-based
% Amazon Machine Image ready to go, with Matlab and Docker installed.
%
% Setting all that up would be outside the scope of this example.

%   members of the Brainard Lab at UPenn -- sorry!  At least, they show you
%   how to call the mjsExecuteAwsCliJob() function.
%
%   The output should look the same as for a local job.  The last message
%   should be "Finished job named "factorBigInt"".
